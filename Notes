1) added surefire plugin
2) tried to create testing.xml
3) tried to run it (with and without command) both options not available

This is what I have added in my pom.xml, but removed it for now because
it didn't give me the option to run my testing.xml file, or use the command "mvn test".

pom.xml content:

 <!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.maven.plugins/maven-surefire-plugin -->
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>3.0.0-M9</version>
                <configuration>
                    <suiteXmlFiles>
                        <suiteXmlFile>testing.xml</suiteXmlFile>
                    </suiteXmlFiles>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>




I created a testing.xml file in the hopes that i could just run it.
here is the content of this file: (i deleted it for now because of the reasons above)

testing.xml content:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<suit name = "Suite">
    <test name = "Test">
        <classes>
            <class name = "at.ac.fhcampuswien.fhmdb.MovieTest">
            </class>
        </classes>
    </test>
</suit






For automatically creating xml file of the class, but I do it manually, for now.
